## STEP 5: No merge conflicts!

```{r partner 1}
### In this code chunk, start with the diamonds dataset (built in to
### ggplot2 package) and create a plot of price vs. carat (or some other
### variables of your choice)

data("diamonds")
#test

```

```{r partner 2}
### In this code chunk, start with the diamonds dataset (built in to
### ggplot2 package) and create a subset based on filtering, e.g., 
### size greater than 1 carat or cut is "Ideal"

library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
data(diamonds)
diamonds %>%
  filter(carat > 1) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point()

#make a table of the number of diamonds with each cut
diamonds %>%
  group_by(cut) %>%
  summarize(n = n())

```

## STEP 7: Uh oh, merge conflicts!

```{r break-it-1}
#partner 1


```

## STEP 11: And even more merge conflicts!

```{r break-it-2}
### Both partners - delete this comment, then write some code here
### to plot, summarize, calculate something simple using the diamonds
### dataset.


```
